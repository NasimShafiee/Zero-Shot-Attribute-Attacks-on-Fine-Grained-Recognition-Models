# Zero-Shot Attribute Attacks on Fine-Grained Recognition Models

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of [Zero-Shot Attribute Attacks on Fine-Grained Recognition Models](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20065-6_16).
> In this work, we propose to learn and compose multiple attribute-based universal perturbations(AUPs) to generate attacks that capture small differences between fine-grained classes, generalize well to previously unseen classes and can be applied in real-time,. Each AUP corresponds to an image-agnostic perturbation on a specific attribute. To build our attack, we compose AUPs with weights obtained by learning a class-attribute compatibility function .
